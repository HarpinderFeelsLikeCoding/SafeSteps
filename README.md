# SafeStep - Google Cloud + MongoDB Atlas Hackathon Solution

**Winner of the Devpost "Ready to Build the Future on the Cloud" Hackathon**

SafeStep is an AI-powered navigation application that combines Google Cloud's AI/ML services with MongoDB Atlas's vector search capabilities to provide data-driven safety insights for urban commuters. Built for the hackathon challenge to create innovative solutions using public datasets and cloud technologies.

## üèÜ Hackathon Achievement

**Challenge**: Pick any public dataset and‚Äîusing Google Cloud's AI/ML services plus MongoDB Atlas's search and vector-search capabilities‚Äîbuild a solution that helps users understand, interact with, or gain new perspectives on that data.

**Solution**: SafeStep ingests the NYC Motor Vehicle Collision dataset into MongoDB Atlas, augments each record with GeoJSON location fields and OpenAI-generated text embeddings, then surfaces that data through both geo-indexing (to query crashes within buffered routes) and k-NN vector indexing (to find semantically similar crash narratives).

    }
  }
];
```

### 3. Geospatial Queries
```javascript
const crashes = await collection.find({
  location: {
    $geoWithin: {
      $geometry: bufferedRouteGeometry
    }
  }
});
```
