# Current Environment Variables Status üîç

Based on your Cloud Run deployment, I can see you have these environment variables set, but some still have placeholder values:

## ‚úÖ Currently Set (but need real values):
```bash
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://harpinder059:VblF558XAIQtoWgw@cluster0.sfo01tn.mongodb.net/safestep?retryWrites=true&w=majority
DB_NAME=NYC_Crashes  
COLL_NAME=NYC_Crash_Data
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-KEgkVwtYdMj-d0MWdtBRsw7uaEvBu7I0E  # ‚ùå This looks incomplete
GOOGLE_CLOUD_API_KEY=AIzaSyAUDcKCjhtyBAaecuPfeSIfCZfgrIBwPhw  # ‚ùå This might be incomplete
```

## üö® Issues to Fix:

### 1. OpenAI API Key Issue
Your current key `sk-proj-KEgkVwtYdMj-d0MWdtBRsw7uaEvBu7I0E` appears to be truncated. 

**OpenAI keys should be much longer, like:**
```
sk-proj-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### 2. Google Cloud API Key Issue  
Your current key `AIzaSyAUDcKCjhtyBAaecuPfeSIfCZfgrIBwPhw` might also be incomplete.

**Google Cloud API keys are typically longer:**
```
AIzaSyxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### 3. MongoDB Connection
Your MongoDB URI looks correct, but let's verify the database name matches what your code expects.

## üîß How to Fix:

### Step 1: Get Complete API Keys
1. **OpenAI**: Go to [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   - Create a new key if needed
   - Copy the COMPLETE key (should be ~51 characters)

2. **Google Cloud**: Go to [console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
   - Check your existing API key or create a new one
   - Make sure it's unrestricted or allows Geocoding + Directions APIs

### Step 2: Update Cloud Run Environment Variables
1. Go to Cloud Run ‚Üí safesteps service
2. Click "EDIT & DEPLOY NEW REVISION"
3. Go to "Variables & Secrets" tab
4. Update with complete values:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-[COMPLETE-51-CHARACTER-KEY]
GOOGLE_CLOUD_API_KEY=AIzaSy[COMPLETE-39-CHARACTER-KEY]
```

### Step 3: Test After Deployment
Visit: `https://safesteps-1018019472350.northamerica-northeast2.run.app/api/health`

You should see:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "services": {
    "mongodb": "connected",
    "openai": "configured", 
    "googleCloud": "configured"
  }
}
```

## üéØ Quick Test
Try this command to test your current deployment:
```bash
curl https://safesteps-1018019472350.northamerica-northeast2.run.app/api/health
```

The response will tell us exactly which services are failing.
